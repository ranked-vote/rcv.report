Fix candidate ID matching and add automatic index.json updates

This commit fixes critical issues with candidate ID matching in NYC elections
and ensures the reports index is automatically updated when reports are generated.

## Candidate ID Matching Fixes

### Handle string IDs in candidates file
- Modified `read_candidate_ids()` in `us_ny_nyc/mod.rs` to handle candidate IDs
  stored as strings in Excel files, not just numbers. Previously, IDs stored as
  strings (like "254130") were silently skipped, causing hundreds of thousands
  of "Candidate ID not found" warnings.

### Merge duplicate candidate names
- Updated `add_id_to_choice()` in `candidate_map.rs` to merge candidates with
  the same name but different external IDs into a single candidate. This fixes
  cases where candidates like "Paperboy Love Prince" appear with multiple IDs
  (258719 and 258824) in the candidates file, which was causing votes to be
  incorrectly attributed to separate candidates.

### Graceful error handling
- Improved error handling in `scan_worksheets_for_race()` to log warnings and
  skip invalid candidate IDs instead of panicking, allowing report generation
  to complete even with malformed ballot data.

## Index.json Auto-Update

### New rebuild_index() function
- Added `rebuild_index()` function in `report.rs` that scans all existing
  report.json files and rebuilds the index.json from scratch. This ensures
  the index stays in sync with all generated reports.

### Integration with preprocess_nyc
- Updated `preprocess_nyc.rs` to call `rebuild_index()` after generating
  reports, ensuring the index is updated when using the optimized NYC
  preprocessing path.

## Dependency Fixes

- Added `calamine = "0.24"` to Cargo.toml to fix compilation errors in
  `efficient_reader.rs` which uses calamine for Excel file reading.

- Fixed Data::String handling in `efficient_reader.rs` to properly match on
  calamine's Data enum instead of using non-existent `as_string()` method.

## Impact

These fixes resolve the issue where NYC 2025/07 elections showed incorrect
winners (e.g., Paperboy Love Prince instead of Zohran Kwame Mamdani) due to
candidate ID mismatches. The index.json is now automatically kept up-to-date
whenever reports are generated, eliminating the need for manual index updates.
